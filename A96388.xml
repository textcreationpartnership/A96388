            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas divers Accounts have been lately publiſh'd, in Print, of ſome late Diviſion and Diſputes between ſome Perſons under the Name of Quakers in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> about ſeveral fundamental Doctrins of the Chriſtian Faith (as is pretended by one Party) which being particularly mentioned, and thereupon occaſion very <hi>unduly</hi> taken by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, to reproach both the Chriſtian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and whole Body of the People commonly called Quakers, and their Holy and Chriſtian Profeſſion, both in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, tho' no ways concerned in the ſaid Diviſion or Matters charged, but rather grieved and troubled at it, and at the indiſcreet and reproachful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof in Print, to the amuſing and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the World therewith, and giving occaſion to the Looſe, Ignorant and Prophane, to ſlight and contemn the Truth and the Intereſt of the tender Religion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We are, therefore, tenderly concerned for Truth's ſake in behalf of the ſaid People (as to the Body of them, and for all of them who are ſincere to God, and faithful to their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principle and Profeſſion) to uſe our Juſt Endeavours to remove the Reproach, and all cauſeleſs Jealouſies concerning us, touching thoſe Doctrins of Chriſtianity, or any of them pretended (or ſuppoſed) to be in queſtion in the ſaid Diviſion: in Relation whereunto We do, in

            <p>We ſincerely profeſs Faith in God by his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, as being our Light and Life, our only way to the Father, and alſo our only Mediator and Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>(a)</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172998:5"/>(as 'tis declared to be) is too wonderful for Mortals to conceive, apprehend or pry into (and more meet for Angels to ſee); the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſilent therein, as to the manner thereof, and we are not curious to enquire or diſpute it; nor do we eſteem it neceſſary to make ourſelves wiſe above <hi>(i)</hi> what's written as to the manner or condition of Chriſt's glorious Body, as in Heaven, no more than to enquire how Chriſt appeared in divers manners or forms <hi>(k),</hi> or how he came in among his Diſciples, the Doors being ſhut <hi>(l)</hi> or how he vaniſhed out of their Sight, after he was riſen.

            <p>'Tis true, that we ought not to lay aſide, nor any to undervalue (but highly to eſteem) true Preaching and the Holy Scriptures, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Belief and Faith of Chriſt, as he died for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, together with Chriſt's Inward and Spiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and work of Grace in the Soul, living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to open the Myſtery of his Death, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to effect both our Reconciliation, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Juſtification; and where-ever Chriſt qualifies and calls any to Preach and Demonſtrate the Myſtery of his Coming.

No ſure, for that would imply inſufficiency in Chriſt and his Light, <hi>as within</hi> them, and to fruſtrate God's good End and Promiſe of Chriſt, and his free and univerſal Love and Grace to Mankind, in ſending his Son. We charitably believe the contrary, that they muſt have ſome true Faith and Intereſt in Chriſt and his Mediation, becauſe of God's free Love in Chriſt to all Mankind, and Chriſt's dying for all Men <hi>(w),</hi> and being given for a Light <hi>of</hi> the Gentiles, and for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth <hi>(x).</hi> And becauſe of their living up ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and faithfully to his Light in them, their being Pious, Conſcientious, accepted and ſaved (as is granted) we cannot reaſonably think a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere pious or godly Man, wholly void of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172998:11"/>God, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Faith in him, and ſincerely to believe the holy Scriptures, and (even the perſon charging <hi rend="margDblQuotes">the other in Print) to <q>own the Body of the People called Quakers, and ſeems to approve of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient faithful and generally approved Friends, Writers or Publiſhers of our Doctrins and Principles, and Preachers among us generally owned and approved by us, as Men of ſound Judgment and underſtanding, and as owning the fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian and Proteſtant Faith.</q> Thus far the Perſon charging, in his ſerious Appeal, p. 6. As alſo the ſame perſon further openly ſignified at the other Friends meeting, that <q>he (and his Friends) had unity with the moſt there as to <hi>the main.</hi> As alſo withall faithful Friends every where, excepting only ſome in their meeting that were unſound,</q> &amp;c. Reaſon &amp; Cauſes, p.</hi> 26. and therefore if moſt on both ſides have Unity as to the Main, we may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably ſuppoſe they do not differ <hi>in the Main</hi> or ſubſtance of Chriſtian Faith or Doctrin before cited (and ſincerely owned and confeſſed by us) if tenderly and duly conſidered by both ſides, as Men ſeeking Peace, Love and Concor'd. Wherefore the difference was very indiſcreetly managed, aggravated, and expoſed to ſeparation, Printing, and Reproach, ſeeing 'twas not <hi>in the Main</hi>—We wholly diſlike of ſuch rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tearing, ſuch dividing and aggravating proceedings and bitter Treatment, and have no Unity therewith—But deſire the Lord in Mercy to Repair Breaches, and heal Backſlidings among them, and all eſteemed Chriſtian Profeſſions and Societies, and incline all to <hi>the Main,</hi> to the True Light, to the ſubſtance and Life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to true Love, fervent Charity and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172998:11"/>Tender-heartedneſs and Forgiveneſs towards one another, and to follow Peace with all Men, and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>

               <p>Many are often alarum'd, in Conſcience here by the Word and Voice of God, who ſtop their Pars, and ſlight thoſe Warnings; but the great and final Alarum of the laft Trumpet, they cannot ſtop their Ears againſt nor eſcape, it will unavoidably ſeize upon, and further awaken them finally to Judgment. They that will not be alarum'd in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences unto Repentance, nor out of their Sins here, muſt certainly be alarum'd to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereafter.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever do now wilfully ſhut their Eyes, hate, contem or ſhun the Light of Chriſt, or his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance within, ſhall, at laſt, be made to ſee, and not be able to ſhun or hide themſelves from his glorious and dreadful. Appearance from Heaven with his mighty Angels, as with Lightning and in flaming Fire, to render Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on all them that know not God, and

               <p>And though many now evade and reject the Inward Convictions and Judgment of the Light, and ſhut up the Records or Books thereof in their own Conſciences, they ſhall all be at laſt opened and every one judged of theſe things, recorded therein, according to their Works, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
